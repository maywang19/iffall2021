        <p>2. I'm really excited for this course! Even though I primarily enrolled because this is a required course, I am looking forward to learning HTML.</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn more about HTML and its applications within art.</p>
        <p>5. I expect that the difference between digital and physical spaces will alter my design decision making, such as with scale and perspective through these mediums.</p>
